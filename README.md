# Sourcing Cost Prediction

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast sourcing costs for various products using historical data. The dataset contains records of sourcing costs over time, and the goal is to build a regression model capable of capturing temporal patterns and seasonal variations to provide accurate predictions. Through exploratory data analysis and model evaluation, different regression algorithms such as polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, XG-Boost, AdaBoost, voting ensemble, and gradient boosting regressor were applied to determine the most effective approach. The Random Forest model emerged as the top performer, showcasing promising results with low Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and high R-squared (R2) score on unseen test data.

## Methodology:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and explore relationships between variables.
- **Model Selection:** Implemented various regression models to forecast sourcing costs, including polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, XG-Boost, AdaBoost, voting ensemble, and gradient boosting regressor.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score on both training and unseen test data.
